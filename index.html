              <h1>That Blue Square Thing</h1>
              
              <p>Looking for Doddle homework tasks that have been "lost"?
                 All my Doddle homework, as well as advice on how to solve the problem in Doddle, are on my Doddle page</p>
              
              <p>That Blue Square Thing deals mainly with Applied ICT and Computing stuff these days. In particular, there's material supporting the CiDA and DiDA qualifications, and the Edexcel (2013) Computer Science GCSE. There some old Applied ICT as well.</p>

              <p>There's still a bit of geography lurking around here, but I stopped teaching that stuff a while back and the old AQA Spec C is now gone. I've left the revision stuff up though and have even been trying to put some of my old teaching resources up as well. If they're useful for anyone then that's fine. You might be looking for some mock exam mark sheets or controlled assessment timekeepers. You'll find them on the Applied ICT Unit 10 page.</p>

              Mini-sites

              These are testing sites or content I host for other people. The exist as their own little website and generally have no links from the main site (other than from here of course).

              Fromus centre site - designed by the lovely Megan (the lovely one note, not that other one :-) )

              Pastel - by Kerrie and Ben (who are also lovely of course). PASTEL are a Community Interest Company who operate in Saxmundham. They operate the Fromus Centre as well as other activities in the area. Don Tricker commissioned both sites which were produced at school as an integral part of the students' A Level work

              AVS - a potential layout for the Alde Valley School site which was never developed

              Milicent Garrett Fawcett - produced by the lovely Katie as part of her extended project work. The team won the Time Team Your Town competition, although I'm not sure the site we built necessarily contributed massively towards that

              Jim - some sample pages for Jim (who is... (you get the idea)). Jim now works in IT. I like to think I may have contributed a little towards that (although whether that's a good or a bad thing I don't know)

              Purely Metal - a sample for a local metal working company that, due to a number of things, was never fully developed

              Dave the Hamster - best not to ask...

              Out & About - a transfer project used by our feeder middle schools (before the county council decided they'd like to choose the worst moment in history to close them)

              Saxons - some work one of my children did for school on Saxon places in Suffolk

              Oxbridge Guide - a PDF resource that came from a very old newsgroup (yes, I remember newsgroups) but that may still be vaguely relevant.

              Think Click - a training SPB for CiDA

              <p>You can send me E-mail at bluesquarething@gmail.com.<br>

              If I teach you then you should probably use my school e-mail address. You can find it on the school e-mail system.<br>

              Please make sure that you include a sensible subject line for your e-mail to help me work out what you're writing to me about. If your e-mail address isn't going to tell me who you are then you might want to include your name as well.<br>

              Make sure that you check with me first before sending attachments. If I don't expect an attachment I always delete it.</p>
              
              <h2>Twitter &amp; other stuff like that</h2>
              <p>In theory I use all sorts of social media. It's just that I don't say very much on it.<br>

              You will find me being very quiet on Twitter @bluesquarething.</p>
