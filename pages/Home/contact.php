        <h2>E-Mail:</h2>
        <p>You can send me E-mail at bluesquarething@gmail.com.<br>

        If I teach you then you should probably use my school e-mail address. You can find it on the school e-mail system.<br>

        Please make sure that you include a sensible subject line for your e-mail to help me work out what you're writing to me about. If your e-mail address isn't going to tell me who you are then you might want to include your name as well.<br>

        Make sure that you check with me first before sending attachments. If I don't expect an attachment I always delete it.</p>

        <h2>Twitter &amp; other stuff like that</h2>
        <p>In theory I use all sorts of social media. It's just that I don't say very much on it.<br>

        You will find me being very quiet on Twitter @bluesquarething.</p>
