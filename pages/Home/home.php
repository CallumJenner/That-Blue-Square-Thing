        <h1>That Blue Square Thing</h1>

        <p>Looking for Doddle homework tasks that have been "lost"?
           All my Doddle homework, as well as advice on how to solve the problem in Doddle, are on my Doddle page</p>

        <p>That Blue Square Thing deals mainly with Applied ICT and Computing stuff these days. In particular, there's material supporting the CiDA and DiDA qualifications, and the Edexcel (2013) Computer Science GCSE. There some old Applied ICT as well.</p>

        <p>There's still a bit of geography lurking around here, but I stopped teaching that stuff a while back and the old AQA Spec C is now gone. I've left the revision stuff up though and have even been trying to put some of my old teaching resources up as well. If they're useful for anyone then that's fine. You might be looking for some mock exam mark sheets or controlled assessment timekeepers. You'll find them on the Applied ICT Unit 10 page.</p>
