    <h2>The Tech Bits:</h2>
    <p>This site was written in strict xhtml using nothing more complex than a text editor and some image editing software. The styling is done the proper way using external stylesheets with hand made CSS. The few odd bits of JavaScript which are used are generally stored externally as well, because that's the proper way to do it.</p>
    <p>I've been through a stage of tweaking and rewiting using Dreamweaver, but seem to have gone back to a basic text editor and hand coding nowadays. I recommend being able to code by hand as it lets you do so much more than a WYSIWYG editor such as Dreamweaver will.</p>
    <p>I write code in TextWrangler these days - a free text editor for Macs with some nice features to make hand coding a little easier. It's a free tool, although only available for Macs. </p>
    <h2>Validation:</h2>
    <p>The html markup on this site has been checked using the W3C validator. This means it should work properly and be solid, reliable code which behaves itself. You can visit the W3C validator.</p>
    <p>Valid CSSLets you know that the Style Sheets (CSS) have also been checked by the W3C validator. Again, you can run any style sheet through the validator yourself to check it.</p>
    <p>I've gone to CSS Level 3 nowadays, mainly to get the cool curved corners on the edge of the page. If you're not seeing them it's probably because you're using IE on an XP machine...</p>
